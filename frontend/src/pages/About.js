						<br />
						Our goal is to connect high school, college students, minorities and
						residents of underserved communities with resources they can't get
						elsewhere. Whether it's be career skills , scholarships , grants,
						continued learning, programs, etc., we want to bridge the the
						knowledge gap within these underserved communities. We want to
						eliminate the gatekeeping of much needed information and create a
						portal where people can easily find resources they desperately need
						to improve their quality of life.
