                    <p>The goal of this app is to connect highschool, college students, minority groups and residents of underserved communities to resources that they wouldnâ€™t have access to otherwise.
                    Whether it be career tips , scholarships , grants, continued learning, programs, etc, We hope to bridge the the knowledge gap within these underserved communities.
                    We want to eliminate the gatekeeping of much needed information and create a hub/gateway where people can easily find resources they desperately need to improve their quality of life.
